<h2>Nanny Of The Marrons</h2>
<p>Queen Nanny or Nanny unknown, (Ashanti, born c.1686-died c.1755), Jamaican National Hero, was a well-known, 18th-century leader of the Jamaican Maroons. Much of what is known about her comes from oral history, as little textual evidence exists. She was born into the Asante people in what is today Ghana, and escaped from slavery after being transported to Jamaica.   
Historical documents refer to her as the "rebels' old 'obeah' woman." Following some armed confrontations, colonial officials reached a settlement for peace. They legally granted "Nanny and the people now residing with her and their heirs ... a certain parcel of Land containing five hundred acres in the parish of Portland . Nanny Town was founded on this land but was destroyed during the First Maroon War in 1734. Another Maroon town was founded by survivors and later known as Moore Town.</p>

</span>
<p>Paul Bogle (1822 – 24 October 1865) was a Jamaican Baptist deacon and activist; he is a National Hero of Jamaica. He was a leader of the 1865 Morant Bay protesters, who marched for justice and fair treatment for all the people in Jamaica. After leading the Morant Bay rebellion, Bogle was captured by government troops, tried and convicted by British authorities under martial law, and hanged on 24 October 1865 in the Morant Bay Court House. Bogle had become a friend of wealthy landowner and fellow Baptist George William Gordon, a mulatto man who served in the Assembly as one of two representatives from St. Thomas-in-the-East parish. Gordon was instrumental in Bogle being appointed deacon of Stony Gut Baptist Church in 1864. Conditions were hard for black peasants, due to social discrimination, flooding and crop failure, and epidemics. The required payment of poll taxes prevented most of them from voting. In August 1865, Gordon criticised the British governor, Edward John Eyre, for sanctioning "everything done by the higher class to the oppression of the negroes"</p>

<h2>George William Gordon</h2>
<p>George William Gordon (1820 – 23 October 1865) was a wealthy Brown (mixed-race) Jamaican businessman, magistrate and politician, one of two representatives to the Assembly from St. Thomas-in-the-East Parish. He was a leading critic of the policies of Jamaican Governor Edward Eyre. After the start of the Morant Bay rebellion in October 1865, Eyre declared martial law, directed troops to suppress the rebellion, and ordered the arrest of Gordon in Kingston. He had him returned to Morant Bay to stand trial under martial law. Gordon was quickly convicted of conspiracy and executed, on suspicion of having planned the rebellion. Gordon's quick execution on flimsy charges during the crisis and the death toll and violence of the suppression resulted in a huge controversy in Britain. Opponents of Eyre and his actions attempted to have him prosecuted for murder, but the case never went to trial; he was forced to resign. The government made Jamaica a Crown Colony, governing it directly for decades. In 1969, Gordon was proclaimed a National Hero of Jamaica.</p>
